Loss or Damage in Transit Delivery by a contractor to a common carrier does not constitute delivery to state agencies or political subdivisions. Any claim for loss or damage incurred during delivery shall be between the contractor and the carrier. The state accepts title only when goods are received regardless of the F.O.B. point. The receiving agency will note all apparent damages in transit on the freight bill and notify the contractor. Discovery of concealed damages or loss will be reported by the receiving agency to the carrier and the contractor within seven days of receipt and prior to removal from the point of delivery if possible. The contractor shall make immediate replacement of the damaged or lost merchandise or be in default of the contract. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to file a claim against the carrier. If damage is to a small quantity, with the approval of the agency, the contractor may deduct the amount of damage or loss from his or her invoice to the agency in lieu of replacement. 15. Freight By signing an I.F.B. the bidder certifies that the bid price(s) offered for F.O.B. destination include only the actual freight charges at the lowest and best rate and is based upon the actual weight of the goods to be shipped. Freight charges are, therefore, established for each individual purchase. If a requirement is bid F.O.B. origin, the contractor shall prepay the charges and add the amount to the invoice. A copy of the freight bill should be attached to all invoices that include freight charges. In a solicitation specifying F.O.B. origin the state will consider freight cost in the evaluation of bids. 16. Termination for Default In case of default by a contractor for failure to deliver or perform in accordance with the contract specifications or terms and conditions, the County may procure the articles or services from other sources and hold the defaulting contractor responsible for any resulting additional purchase and administrative costs. The County will normally repurchase from the next low bidder or purchase competitively by resolicitation. If the repurchase results in increased costs to the County, a letter will be sent to the defaulted contractor required payment for additional costs. When repayment is requested, the contractor will be removed from future bidding until the repayment has occurred. Contractors shall not be liable for any excess cost if the failure to perform arises out of any act of war, order of legal authority, strikes, act of God, or other unavoidable causes 3 | P a g e Engineering Services RFP #2020-05-21 not attributed to their fault or negligence. Failure of a contractor's source to deliver is generally not considered to be an unavoidable cause. The burden of proof rests with the contract.

In such event the County will only be liable for cost incurred to the date of termination. All costs of de-installation and return of the equipment will be at the Contractor's expense. The County's failure to exercise its right to terminate for default under this provision shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to terminate, rescind or revoke this contract in the event of any subsequent breach of any provisions of this agreement.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND Project description should include a detailed project location and limits. Project background includes project location history, funding type and solicitation. Include any background materials and links to previous PSR s or publications. Please see example info below. Example description: Clark Road is a principal arterial which connects upper and lower Paradise. Clark Road is the second most frequently traveled road in the Town of Paradise. Upper Clark Road is a narrow roadway with a reverse horizontal and vertical curve located at Cypress Road and Forest Service Lane. Coupled with high vehicle volumes and speeds this corridor presents a dangerous environment for drivers. The road has an existing two-lane cross section with multiple private and public road encroachments between Kimberly Lane and Adams Road. The Town identified the Cypress Curve Realignment Project through a jurisdiction-wide collision analysis using the SafeTREC Transportation Injury Mapping System. Analysis of the Town's network shows a high concentration of collisions with severe injuries along Clark Road between Adams Road and Kimberly Lane. This segment includes two fatal collisions in a two year period within 1,000 feet of each other. Both fatal collisions included road departure. The proposed project includes two countermeasures: improve horizontal alignment (flatten curves) and widen shoulders. Some minimal preliminary engineering began on this project in 2003. According to historical project files, required Right-of-Way has been acquired by the Town of Paradise to realign the horizontal curves from a compound/reverse curve to standard AASHTO horizontal curves. More information regarding specific countermeasures and requirements can be found by reviewing the Caltrans Local Road Safety Manual.

12.pdf,"Hemisfair Park Area Redevelopment Corporation San Antonio, Texas June 1, 2021 Request for Proposal Hemisfair Augmented Reality Project development and design of an augmented reality tree donor recognition program Table of Contents Table of Contents Executive Summary General Information Project Description Deliverables Submittal Requirements Submittal Details Process & Schedule Submittal Instructions Disclaimer Executive Summary Hemisfair Park Area Redevelopment Corporation (HPARC or Hemisfair) presents an opportunity for design and development of an Augmented Reality (AR) tree donor recognition digital application. Through this Request for Proposal (RFP) we hope to attract a firm with AR and app creation experience, and familiarity working with a non-profit organization. HPARC is a not-for-profit local government corporation incorporated in the State of Texas. HPARC and the Hemisfair Conservancy, a separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization, are working together to revitalize the site of the 1968 World s Fair into a 40-acre urban parks district where people can live, work and play. Our aspirational vision is to create one of the world s great public places. Our mission is to provide a vibrant and inviting parks district that is authentic to San Antonio. HPARC is a component unit of the City of San Antonio and receives the majority of its funds from municipal sources, including city wide capital bond programs. The Hemisfair Conservancy helps bring the vision to life by raising philanthropic contributions to augment public funds. HPARC, at this time, receives no Federal or State funds. The budget range for this project is $50,000 - $100,000. General Information Site Information The Hemisfair District encompasses approximately 40 acres. Nineteen acres are dedicated to public parkland and over 17 acres are set aside for public-private partnership developments. The balance of the area is dedicated street right-of-way. Background Before the 1968 World s Fair, the ground where Hemisfair sits today was part of a residential neighborhood, whose construction dates stretch back into the mid-1800s. During the World s Fair, some of these historic houses were converted to non-residential use, serving as restaurants, administrative offices and fair amenities; until very recently, some of the properties were used as city and civic offices. HPARC was established in 2009 to manage and oversee the redevelopment and management of the Hemisfair area. It is important to note that HPARC does not profit from its leasing activities. Rather, all proceeds from lease revenues go back into the park and are used to fund operations, maintenance, development, administration and activation of the Hemisfair parks; this creates a financially sustainable organization over time. This is a monumental achievement for a public place because it ensures its relevance and existence for generations to come, rather than relying on city investment to continue to thrive. Project Description Our Hemisfair tree-planting program is popular, and we are looking for an innovative way to recognize the tree donors. The trees that have been planted are not little saplings, they are mature trees with full canopy providing full shade from the day parks open. This work requires significant philanthropic investment. Trees are planted as tributes to memorialize a loved one that has passed, or honor someone who is living. Donors and all park visitors will be able to download the newly created app to access the AR tree donor recognition experience. Our vision for the app is that a user will be able to scan a tree s QR code, hold their mobile device to view the tree through its camera and see a photo and text pop up next to the tree. Audio will also begin after the QR code is scanned for those donors who wish to include a recorded tribute to their loved one. Approximately 230 trees spread throughout Yanaguana Garden (our first park that opened in 2015) and Civic Park (to open in 2023) will be included. Future scope will include trees at Tower Park, which may open in 2025, depending on funding. Figure 1: An aerial map of the Hemisfair District. The green space in Yanaguana Garden and Civic Park alone covers 13 acres in downtown San Antonio. Since we ve already started planting donor-sponsored trees at Yanaguana Garden, creating and launching a pilot program for these trees this year is necessary. At Civic Park, the rows of Mexican Sycamores that flank the main promenade are 20 feet apart across the promenade (east-west direction) from each other, and about 18 feet apart along the length of the promenade (north-south). Figure 2: Map of Yanaguana Garden. Green dots identify newly planted trees. Yellow dots represent available locations for planting a tree. Figure 3: Layout of Civic Park showing tree variety placement. Successful development of the AR platform will open the door for potential contract expansion. Future app additions could include information for renderings of future phases, historic structures, and park amenities. Deliverables The scope of work includes the following deliverables: 1. Create an app for Apple iOS and Android, using Hemisfair s branding guidelines, that will work on the following devices: all iPhone, iPad and Android models; 2. Use QR codes and GPS technology to activate the AR program; a. QR codes needed for placement at park entrances in order for visitors to download and activate the app; b. QR codes needed for placement on park trees; c. Provide custom design services for Hemisfair specific QR Code badges and produce the first 250 badges for installation by HPARC staff. 3. AR experience to pop up near a tree that has already been claimed showing a photo, text and/or audio about the person being honored/memorialized. a. QR codes on unclaimed trees will lead the app user to more information about Hemisfair s tree-planting program. 4. App will incorporate a drop-down menu for the following: a. A  Search for Tree  option to find the recognition name. b. A map function to help app users find a specific tree by showing a pathway to its location. Users can also open an interactive map of the park, select a tree and receive walking directions to the tree. c. Details about the tree-planting program. d. A link to hemisfair.org/donate. e. App sponsor recognition page. 5. Design the app to ADA digital standards: a. Ensure audio content has captions, b. Menus, links, and buttons are easy to differentiate from each other and navigate, c. Minimal blinking and/or flashing. d. If possible, translate app content into Spanish. 6. Develop an easy to learn Customer Management System for staff (non-programmers) to upload and maintain donor information about each tree. a. Define parameters for size and format of picture elements, audio and text length. b. Provide means to acquire new QR code badges for additional trees. c. Provide sufficient training for two HPARC staff members. 7. Create AR app FAQ to post on Hemisfair s website. 8. Provide one-year warranty for service and support. 9. App will be owned by Hemisfair.

As used in this provision- ""Authorized representative(s) of the offeror"" means the person(s) identified to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within the consent to disclose by the offeror as authorized to represent the offeror in disclosure matters pertaining to the offer. ""Delinquent Federal tax liability"" means any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. ""Tax check"" means an IRS process that accesses and uses taxpayer return information to support the Government's determination of an offeror's eligibility to receive an award, including but not limited to implementation of the statutory prohibition of making an award to corporations that have an unpaid Federal tax liability (see FAR 9.104-5(b)).

If the offeror recently settled a delinquent Federal tax liability, the offeror may want to take steps to obtain information in order to demonstrate the offeror's responsibility to the contracting officer (see FAR 9.104-5). (c) The offeror shall execute the consent to disclosure provided in paragraph (d) of this provision and include it with the submission of its offer. The consent to disclosure shall be signed by an authorized person as required and defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(c) and 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1(e)(4). (d) Consent to disclosure.

H. (In accordance with FAR 32.206(c), the contracting officer shall specify, to the extent access is necessary, Information and/or facilities to which the Government shall have access for the purpose of verifying the contractor s entitlement to payment of contract financing.) Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements for the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (JUL 2019) (a) Definitions: ""Short payment"" as used in this clause means the partial payment of an invoice for goods/services rendered at the time of payment when the invoice includes additional goods/services that have not yet been provided/rendered.  Short payment  example: The contract requires the delivery of a set number of items, with the price, delivery location, and delivery due date also specified. The vendor delivers 50% of the items as specified but invoices for 100% of the items. Before implementation of the IPP, the IRS would have paid the vendor for the items delivered and instructed the vendor to re-invoice the IRS when the balances of the items were delivered. In other words, the IRS would ""short pay"" the invoice since the IRS did not remit payment for the full invoice amount. With implementation of the IPP, the IRS can no longer do this because the IRS cannot accept an electronic invoice that includes items not yet received. The IRS will reject the invoice. The vendor needs to submit an invoice for only the items received by the IRS (in this case, 50%), and, if these items meet all other contract terms and conditions, the IRS will pay the invoiced amount. The vendor submits subsequent invoice(s) for items as they are delivered and accepted. (b) The Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) is a secure Web-based electronic invoicing and payment information service available to all Federal agencies and their suppliers. Effective October 1, 2012, invoicing for payment through the IPP will be mandatory for all new contract awards. Additional information regarding the IPP may be found at the IPP website address https://www.ipp.gov. Contractors must complete the contractor point of contact information below and submit it with their proposal submissions. Contractors may contact the IPP Helpdesk for assistance via e-mail at ippgroup@stls.frb.org or via phone at (866) 973-3131. Once a contract award has been made, the contractor will be contacted by the IPP via e-mail to set-up an account. It will be necessary for contractors to login to their IPP accounts every 90 days to keep their IPP accounts active. (c) Contractor Point of Contact Information Contractor Name: Contractor IPP Point of Contact Name: Contractor Phone Number: Contractor E-mail Address: (d) Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements Vendor invoices submitted electronically through the IPP should be in the proper format and contain the information required for payment processing. To be approved for payment, a  proper invoice  must list the items specified in FAR 52.232-25 (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x), or in the case of a Commercial Item Contract, the items included in 52.212-4(g)(1)(i) through (g)(1)(x). If the vendor is offering a discount via the IPP, the discount must be reflected on the invoice. The vendor will select 'Create Invoice'. The IPP system will default to  Net 30 Prompt Pay  under the Payment Terms dropdown box. The vendor will select from 54 different discount options for the invoice that is being created. If the vendor chooses to offer a discount on the invoice screen, the information will interface to the payment system for processing. Discounts that are offered on attachments rather than the invoice itself cannot be accepted. Under this contract, the following documents are required to be submitted as an attachment to the invoice (Contracting Officer fills in additional documentation that must be furnished by the contractor (e.g., timesheet)). Please do not submit into IPP any documentation/attachments that conflict with what is stated on the invoice: Payment and Invoice Questions For payment and invoice questions, contact the Ancillary Systems at (304) 254-3372 or via e- mail at cfo.fm.ipp.customer.support@irs.gov. (e) Waiver If the Contractor is unable to use the IPP for submitting payment requests starting on October 1, 2012, then a waiver form must be completed and submitted with the contractor s proposal submission for review and approval by the Contracting Officer based on one of the conditions listed in the waiver. The vendor will be notified prior to award as to whether their request for waiver has been approved or denied. If the waiver is granted, then a copy of the waiver must be submitted with each paper invoice that the vendor submits to the payment office or the invoice will be returned. (f) Short Payment Short payment on vendor submitted invoices will no longer be processed or paid. If any portion of the invoice does not meet the requirements for a proper invoice, the entire invoice shall be rejected and returned to the vendor unpaid. IRS Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) Waiver Form The IRS invoicing and payment requirements clause (IR1052.232-9000) requires that all invoices under awards made (or effective) on or after October 1, 2012, be submitted electronically via the IPP unless a waiver is requested and granted. If the Contractor is unable to submit its invoice through the IPP, the Contractor shall complete this waiver form indicating the reason for the waiver request by selecting the appropriate box below and providing a narrative summarizing in detail the circumstances requiring a waiver. For a solicitation, submit the waiver form with the proposal submission. For a modification that incorporates the IPP clause into an existing contract, submit the waiver form with the modification. The CO will notify the vendor via e-mail or another appropriate means of communication prior to award as to whether their waiver has been approved or denied. If the waiver is granted, then a copy of the approved waiver must be submitted with each invoice that the vendor submits to the payment office or the invoice will be returned. Reason for requesting a waiver of the requirement to submit an electronic invoice via the IPP: 1. Submission of invoices through IPP would impose a hardship on an individual (includes employees and sole proprietors) due to either a physical or mental disability; a geographic, language, or literacy barrier; or an undue financial burden. The requirement to submit invoices through the IPP is automatically waived for all individuals who do not have payment capability using ACH with a U.S. financial institution. 2. The political, financial or communications infrastructure where the place of business is located does not support access to the IPP for submitting invoices electronically. 3. The contractor is located within an area designated by the President of the United States or an authorized agency administration as a disaster area. (Please identify area/location.) 4. The submission of invoices electronically may pose a threat to national security, the life or physical safety of an individual may be endangered, or a law enforcement action may be compromised. 5. The agency does not expect to receive more than one invoice from the same contractor within a one-year period. i.e., the invoice submission is non- recurring. 6. The contractor customarily submits a high volume of invoices on a regular basis via file format, not currently supported by the IPP (i.e., uses a file format other than XML or CSV) and the high volume of invoices would cause a significant burden to the contractor if submitted through the IPP individually. If utilizing this exception, please identify the file formats supported by your invoicing system so that the IPP may consider implementing the requested file format at a later date. File format(s) used: 7. Other - Please explain: Attach a separate sheet of paper with a summary narrative substantiating the circumstances for the waiver exception selected from above (1 through 7).

Contractor (including subcontractor) personnel, like Federal employees, have no inherent right to use Government IT resources and this policy does not create the right to use Government IT resources for nongovernmental purposes. See IRM 10.8.27, Exhibit 10.8.27-1, Prohibited Uses of Government IT Resources, for specific examples of prohibited uses. See Title 5 - Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) - Part 734   Political Activities of Federal Employees, for specific examples of prohibited political activities. b. Contractors and subcontractors are required to report a suspected or confirmed breach in any medium or form, electronically, verbally or in hardcopy form, immediately upon discovery. All incidents related to IRS processing, information or information systems shall be reported immediately upon discovery to the CO, COR, and CSIRC. Contact the CSIRC through any of the following methods: I Telephone: 240.613.3606 E-mail to csirc@irs.gov o Information about unclassified cyber security incidents of a sensitive nature shall be transmitted using secure messaging or alternative forms of encryption. o If the incident involves the loss or theft of an IRS IT asset, e.g., computer, laptop, router, printer, removable media (CD/DVD, flash drive, floppy, etc.), or non-IRS IT asset (BYOD device), or a loss or theft of hardcopy records/documents containing SBU data, including PII and tax information , the contractor shall also report the incident/situation to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) hotline at 800-366- 4484. 6. Replacement Personnel. Contractor personnel who violate any conditions set forth in the clause are subject to removal from performance under the contract. The Government will provide notice to the Contractor of any contractor personnel no longer eligible for performance under the contract. The Contractor shall provide the name of the proposed replacement personnel to the CO and COR within five (5) business days from receipt of notice. The Contractor shall ensure replacement personnel have similar or equal credentials to the personnel being replaced. 7. Monitoring Notification. IRS management retains the right to monitor both the content and the level of access of contractor personnel use of IRS IT systems. Contractor personnel do not have a right, nor should they have an expectation, of privacy while using any IRS information technology system at any time, including accessing the Internet or using e-mail. 8. Security Reports and Information. If any reports are required, the COR may direct the submission of such reports and information through a specific IRS application, to be determined, or the entry of specific information into the application or system. 9. Subcontracts. The Contractor shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts, subcontract task or delivery orders or other subcontract performance instrument where the subcontractor personnel will require staff-like access, use or operation of IRS information technology systems. 10. Flow down of clauses: The contractor shall include and flow down, in its subcontracts (or arrangements or outsourced service agreements) that entails access to SBU information by a subcontractor, at any tier, the substantially same Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and local security or safeguard clauses or provisions for protecting SBU information or information systems that apply to and are incorporated in its prime contract with IRS. Information Systems and Information Security Controls for Contracting Actions Subject to Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 10.8 Series (APR 2024) In performance of this contract, the contractor agrees to comply with the following requirements and assumes responsibility for compliance by its personnel and subcontractors (and their personnel): (a) General.

The contractor shall adhere to the general guidance and specific security control standards or requirements contained in IRM 10.5 and IRM10.8 series. While the IRM 10.8 series shall apply to the requirements to access systems, and IRM 10.5 series shall apply to access SBU data, IRS Publication 4812, Contractor Security & Privacy Controls, may also govern as addressed in another clause. It will address the requirements related to physical and personnel security that must continue to be maintained at contractor sites. (c) Based on the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), and standards and guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), IRM 10.8 series provides overall IT security control guidance for the IRS, and uniform policies and guidance to be used by each office, or business, operating, and functional unit within the IRS that uses IRS information systems to accomplish the IRS mission. (d) Contractor Security Representative. The contractor shall assign and identify, in its offer, a Contractor Security Representative (CSR) and alternate CSR to all contracts requiring staff-like access to IRS information, information technology and systems, facilities, and/or assets. The CSR is the contractor s primary point for the Government on all security-related matters and the person responsible for ensuring the security of information and information systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and all applicable security controls. If required by the Contracting Officer s Representative, the contractor will be required to input data into a system, to be defined by the IRS, to describe the security controls being used to protect information. (e) Flow down of clauses. The contractor shall include and flow down, in its subcontracts (or arrangements or outsourced service agreements) that entail staff- like access to SBU information by a subcontractor or agent, at any tier, the substantially same Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and local security or safeguard clauses or provisions for protecting SBU information or information systems that apply to and are incorporated in its prime contract with IRS. Information Systems and Information Security Controls for Contracting Actions Subject to IRS Publication 4812 (APR 2024) Publication 4812 is an IRS specific guide to NIST SP 800-53 (version 4.0) when staff- like access to IRS information or information systems under contracts for services on behalf of the IRS is outside of IRS controlled facilities or the direct control of the Service (as opposed to Internal Revenue Manual 10.8.1 - Information Technology (IT) Security, Policy and Guidance, which applies when contractors are accessing IRS information and information systems at Government controlled facilities). The IRS Publication 4812 is a living document and updated annually to reflect changes from Executive Orders, OMB requirements, NIST updates, etc. The most current version (October 2019) of Publication 4812 is located on the irs.gov website. In performance of this contract, the contractor agrees to comply with the following requirements and assumes responsibility for compliance by its personnel and subcontractors (and their personnel): 1. The contractor shall ensure IRS information and information systems (those of the IRS and/or the contractor, as appropriate) are protected at all times. In order to do so, the contractor shall develop, implement, and maintain effective controls and methodologies in its business processes, physical environments, and human capital or personnel practices that meet or otherwise adhere to the security controls, requirements, and objectives described in applicable security control guidelines, and their respective contracts. (a) The contractor will be required to input data into a system, to be defined by the IRS, to describe the security controls being used to protect information. Publication 4812 applicability. This contracting action is subject to Publication 4812   Contractor Security & Privacy Controls. Publication 4812 is available at: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4812.pdf (b) The contractor shall adhere to the general guidance and specific security control standards or requirements contained in Publication 4812. By inclusion of this clause in the contract, the most recent version of Publication 4812 is incorporated into the contract and has the same force and effect as if included in the main body of the immediate contract. 2. Flowing down from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) and standards and guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Publication 4812 identifies basic Technical, Operational, and Management (TOM) security controls and standards required of under contracts for services in which contractor (or subcontractor) personnel will either  (a) Have staff-like access to, develop, operate, or maintain IRS information or information systems on behalf of the IRS (or provide related services) outside of IRS facilities or the direct control of the Service, and/or (b) Have staff-like access to, compile, process, or store IRS SBU information on their own information systems/Information Technology (IT) assets or that of a subcontractor or third- party Service Provider, or when using their own information systems (or that of others) and on IT, or Electronic Information and Technology (EIT) (as defined in FAR Part 2) other than that owned or controlled by the IRS. 3. Unless the manual specifies otherwise, the IRS-specific requirements in Publication 4812 meet the standard from the latest version of the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 (Version 4.0)   Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The security controls, requirements, and standards described within the Publication 4812 are to be used in lieu of the common, at-large security control standards enumerated in NIST SP 800-53 (Version 4.0). Publication 4812 also describes the framework and general processes for conducting contractor security reviews   performed by IT Cybersecurity to monitor compliance and assess the effectiveness of security controls applicable to any given contracting action subject to Publication 4812. 4. Contractor Security Representative. The contractor shall assign and identify, upon award, a Contractor Security Representative (CSR) and alternate CSR to all contracts requiring staff-like access to Treasury/bureau information, information technology and systems, facilities, and/or assets. The CSR is the contractor s primary point for the Government on all security-related matters and the person responsible for ensuring the security of information and information systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and all applicable security controls. 5. Flow down of clauses. The contractor shall include and flow down, in its subcontracts (or arrangements or outsourced service agreements) that entails staff- like access to SBU information by a subcontractor, at any tier, the same Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and local security or safeguard clauses or provisions for protecting SBU information or information systems that apply to and are incorporated in its prime contract with IRS. IRS Publication 4812 also applies to subcontractors. Information System and Information Security Control Standards and Guidelines Applicability (APR 2024) As part of its information security program, IRS identifies security controls for the organization s information and information systems in the following two key standards and guiding documents: o Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 10.8.1   Information Technology (IT) Security, Policy and Guidance, and o Publication 4812   Contractor Security & Privacy Controls. While IRM 10.8.1 and Publication 4812 are both based on the latest version of NIST SP 800- 53, they apply to different operating environments internal and external to the organization, respectively. The contractor, by signing its offer, hereby asserts to the best of its knowledge and belief that the security control guideline(s) most suitable and applicable to the immediate contracting action, with due consideration to its proposed approach (and work environment) for fulfilling the Government s requirements and standards for applicability described herein, is as follows (check only one block): IRM 10.8.1 Publication 4812 Both IRM 10.8.1 and Publication 4812 Unless IRS Cybersecurity, (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA) determines, through a notification to the Contractor by the CO, that a different (or a second) security control standard or guideline is warranted, the security level selected/applied for by the contractor under IR1052.239-9010 shall stand. In the event IRS Cybersecurity (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA) determines a different (or second) security control standard or guideline is warranted, the CO shall advise the contractor, in writing, of the Government determination, and reflect the correct/appropriate security control standard or guideline in the ensuing contract. a. If Publication 4812 is selected (alone or in combination with IRM 10.8.1) as the most suitable security control guideline, the Contractor must identify, as part of its proposal submissions (or its submissions under any modification to an existing contract incorporating this clause), the most suitable security control level within the following hierarchy of security control levels (from lowest or highest):   Software Application Development or Maintenance (SOFT)   Networked Information Technology Infrastructure (NET) (See Publication 4812, Appendix C for guidance in selecting the security control level most suitable and appropriate to the immediate contracting action. If additional guidance is needed in selecting the security control level, contact IRS Cybersecurity (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA). b. The contractor, by signing its offer, hereby asserts to the best of its knowledge and belief that the security control level under Publication 4812 most suitable and applicable to the immediate contracting action, with due consideration to its proposed approach (and work environment) and standards for applicability described herein, is as follows (check only one): SOFT NET c. Unless IRS Cybersecurity (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA) determines that a different (higher or lower) security control level is warranted for contracts subject to the most recent version of Publication 4812, the security level selected/applied for by the contractor will govern throughout the life of the contract. In the event the IRS Cybersecurity (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA) determines a different (higher or lower) security level is warranted, the CO will advise the contractor, in writing, of the Government determination. At the end of the contract, for all security levels, the contractor must provide a plan and document the implementation of this plan to ensure that all hard copy and electronic data is returned to the IRS, sanitized, or destroyed. d. Failure by the contractor to check any block will result in the use of both guidelines (for the Publication 4812 portion, use of the most stringent security control level (Software)) until and unless IRS Cybersecurity (Contractor Security Assessment - CSA), determines otherwise via notification to the Contractor by the CO. e. If required by the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR), the contractor will be required to input data into a system, to be defined by the IRS, to describe the security controls being used to protect information. f. Flow down of clauses. The contractor shall include and flow down, in its subcontracts (or arrangements or outsourced service agreements) that entails staff- like access to SBU information by a subcontractor, at any tier, the substantially same Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and local security or safeguard clauses or provisions for protecting SBU information or information systems that apply to and are incorporated in its prime contract with IRS. Post Award Evaluation of Contractor Performance (JUN 2020) Interim and final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared on this contract in accordance with FAR 42.15. The Assessing Official (e.g., Contracting Officer) will prepare a final performance evaluation at the time the work on the contract is completed. In addition to the final evaluation, interim evaluations will be prepared annually to coincide with the anniversary date of the contract. (**If evaluations are conducted annually, modify the above sentence appropriately.) The past performance evaluation process is a paperless process using the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. The completed evaluation was previously available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), but since the General Services Administration officially retired PPIRS and merged it with CPARS, it created  a single system  that  provides one location and one account to perform functions such as creating and editing performance and integrity records, changes to administering users, running reports, generating performance records, and viewing/managing performance records. Once the Contractor is registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically- generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at https://www.cpars.gov/ The CPARS User Manual, registration for Online Training for Contractors, and a practice application may be found at this site as well. Interim and final evaluations will be provided to the Contractor for their review and comment as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. Evaluations of contractor past performance will be posted to the relevant past performance database no more than 14 days after the information is provided to the contractor. On day 15, whether the contractor has responded or not, the evaluation automatically posts to PPIRS. If the Contractor elects not to provide comments, they should acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating ""No comment"" and then sign and date the form. If the Contractor does not sign and submit the form within 14 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government. Contractors who disagree with a government evaluation can request to meet with the Contracting Officer to discuss their scores and provide feedback or justification for their performance. No requirement exists for the government to meet with the contractor; however, if a contractor requests a meeting, the government may accept the request. Any such meeting does not alter the requirement that an evaluation be posted to PPIRS within 14 days. Several avenues still exist for the contractor to influence the review. First, the contractor may submit a comment after the 14-day period expires and the review has been posted to PPIRS. The contractor s late comments must be posted to PPIRS; however, the government s original report will still be available to all source selection officials. Although authorized, an agency is not required to modify its evaluation based upon a contractor s comments. Second, the contractor may appeal its review one level above the Contracting Officer to the Reviewing Official. Again, the appeal does not stop the 14- day reporting period and the original evaluation will be posted on PPIRS. The following guidelines apply concerning the Contractor's use of the past performance evaluation:   Protect the evaluation as ""source selection information."" After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason the Contractor is unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for further instructions.   Strictly control access to the evaluation within the Contractor's organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of the Contractor's control.   Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre- award surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.   A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for the Contractor's review and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.
